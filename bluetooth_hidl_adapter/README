This project is used when:

1.you want to use you own bluetooth stack but not bluedroid in Android;

2.Android version beyond O, with which your stack should communicate with
android.hardware.bluetooth@1.0-service through Binder.


How to use this project:

1.copy this project to the root path of Android tree;

2.in Android root path:
    
    source build/envsetup.sh,
    lunch XXX
    cd bluetooth_hidl_adapter
    mm  

3.then you can find the lib in /out dir.


In your bluetooth stack, you need to implement struct bt_hidl_cb_t(which is
defined in bt_hidladapter.h). When enable BT, use the struct to call function
hci_initialize(). Call back functions in struct bt_hidl_cb_t would be called
in proper scenario. When stack want to send data to HCI, just encapsulate data
with a BT_HDR, and call function hci_transmit(). When you disable BT, just call
hci_close().
